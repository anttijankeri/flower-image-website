# plant-image-website

This project is a website for both desktop and mobile. It should use the anttijankeri/image-database backend repo. The site should allow users to create listings of plants with some data: Name, date acquired, plant group, price, images (for now.) Each plant should be saved into the backend and retrievable later via email/password authentication. The user should be able to filter their plants with any of the text values. They should also be able to fetch a list of the filtered - or all - plant listings as a file. The users should also be able to link a plant listing or image and share it to others if wanted. Finally, the user should be able to delete their data from the server.

The coding language is **Typescript**
