# plant-image-website

This project is a website for both desktop and mobile. It should use the anttijankeri/image-database backend repo. The site should allow users to upload images into the database, and view them later. They should also be able to group images together, and add text to either groups or single images. The site should also use cookie-based sessions for authentication with the backend. Finally, the site should allow users to link their own images out without authentication for sharing purposes. The coding language should be Typescript.
